## Install support using the Arduino IDE

Here's how to install the Arduino-ESP32 directly from the Arduino IDE.

> Starting with Arduino IDE version 1.6.4, Arduino allows installing third-party platform packages using the Boards Manager. There are packages for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Arduino IDE download link: https://www.arduino.cc/en/software

> The UI of Arduino IDE 2.0 is slightly different from Arduino IDE 1.8.x. This article is written based on version 1.8.13, but it does not affect the reference of users who use version 2.0.

To install the esp32 platform package using Boards Managaer, follow these steps:

- Install current upstream Arduino IDE 1.8 or higher.

- Start Arduino and open the File > Preferences window and find Additional Board Manager URLs.
