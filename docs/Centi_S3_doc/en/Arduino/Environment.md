This is the way to install Arduino-ESP32 directly from the Arduino IDE.

- Stable version link: https://espressif.github.io/arduino-esp32/package_esp32_index.json

- Development version link: https://espressif.github.io/arduino-esp32/package_esp32_dev_index.json

> Starting with the Arduino IDE version 1.6.4, Arduino allows installation of third-party platform packages using Boards Manager. We have packages available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

To start the installation process with Boards Managaer, follow these steps:

- Install the current upstream Arduino IDE at the 1.8 level or later. The current version is at the [arduino.cc website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).

- Start Arduino and open the File>Preferences window.
