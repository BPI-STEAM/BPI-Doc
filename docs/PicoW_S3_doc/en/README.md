Banana Pi BPI-PicoW is a low-power microcontroller, a development board designed for IoT development and Maker DIY. The same size as the Raspberry Pi Pico board, supports 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi and Bluetooth® LE dual-mode wireless communication, peripherals are compatible with low-power hardware design, and consumes only 10uA in deep sleep mode. In terms of programming, PicoW-S3 supports ESP-IDF, Arduino, micropython, CircuitPython and other methods

## Programming with MicroPython

By flashing the MicroPython firmware, you can use the Python language for programming on the development board.

Will provide rich sample code and professional IDE support (such as: VsCode, PyCharm).
