Regardless of the programmer is a beginner or not, MicroPython is considered to be less difficult to develop than other MCU programming languages.

Its code is easy to understand compared to other programming languages, and it has various resources accumulated over the years by the open source community.

Just like Python, it has strong vitality and application value.

By uploading the MicroPython firmware, you can use the Python language to program in the development board.

## Programming with CircuitPython
