In the front of Triode Car, there are two screw holes, which can be used to fix sensors such as obstacle avoidance sensors or line following sensors. 2. Next to the adjustable resistor, there are two pairs of special resistors, R11 and R13, R12 and R14. If you choose to weld R11 and R12, the LED will automatically display the state of the motor, whether it is forward or stopped. If you choose to weld R13 and R14, The LED will become a programmable LED light, P11 controls the left LED (D3), and P5 controls the right light (D4). 3. Triode Car has specially designed pads for manual soldering (Controller Socket marked position). Through this design, it is more convenient to manually solder the Bit Socket, and if you want to quickly confirm the position of the Pin during use, you don’t need to confirm repeatedly. Schematic diagram and pin number. 4. Behind the Bit Socket, there is a switch that can switch between two control methods: IC switch and Bit switch. 5. Behind the switch, there is a 30*15mm square hole, which is used to leave room for the speed sensor. After adding the speed sensor, the position of the battery box may be occupied. At this time, we recommend that you use copper pillars, plastic plates, etc. to elevate the battery box. [Recommended speed sensor](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3986) 6. Just below the Triode Car, there are some holes that can be welded at will. The leftmost one of the holes is connected to the positive pole of the power supply, the rightmost one is connected to the negative pole, Some IOs are placed in the upper row for use. You can add some sensors or buzzers in this area to make your car more versatile. Of course, there may be insufficient power supply after adding, it is recommended to use a lithium battery with a stronger current. ## GPIO PIN define Function web:bit GPIO : : : : Wheel(Left) P14 Wheel(Right) P15 ultrasonic (Trig) P12 ultrasonic (Echo) P13 Line Detecting(Left) P2 Line Detecting(Right) P1 Speed Detection(Left) P11 Speed Detection(Right) P5 ## Product standard list 1.

Calibration of the Line Following Circuit improves the reaction time of the Triode Car's line tracking feature. Adjust the resistance of the potentiometers connected to the photoresistors to increase the sensitivity. This process makes the Triode Car less likely to run off course and maintains a stable analog voltage output. We can directly use the [Collect the signals](read_LDR.html)guide from beginners tutorial to read the analog signals from the computer, then manually adjust the potentiometer with a screwdriver. The micro:bit can detect analog voltage values from 0~1023, the closer the value is to the middle, the reaction from changes of brightness detected by the photoresistor will become more sensitive. Therefore, under a stable brightness environment, try to calibrate the resistance as close to 512 as possible. This would create more stable energy output and reduce their analog value difference. The above steps mentioned requires constant connection with triode car connected to micro: bit and then to the PC. In a real use case scenerio, one would best be using manual adjustments to increase the sensitivity. We cannot be sure to have the micro: bit connected to the PC all the time, therefore, we need to write a program to guide us how to properly calibrate the sensitivity. Calibration Steps: 1. Adjust the left potentiometers first, to make its analog value out close to the median. 2. Adjust the right potentiometer on the premise that the previous condition is met, so that the parallel photoresistor output voltage analog quantity on the corresponding pin of Micro:Bit is close to the other photoresistor. We can achieve this by creating a simple \"if\" statement program. For those people who adjust manually, we could add different image patterns to indicate if we have adjusted properly. ## Example Blocks: <div align center> <img src \"../assets/Triode car_LDR_calibration_1.png\" width \"600\"/> </div> [Example project file on Github](https://github.com/Wind stormger/Makecode/blob/master/microbit Triode car_LDR_calibration_2.hex) > After the project file is downloaded locally, it can be imported into MakeCode for viewing and re editing, or it can be burned directly to micro:bit via USB to run. ## Design description 1. The whole calibration code is organized into a self defined function, this could be easily called or maintained later on and would cause less confusion as many other functions would be added. 2. The code consists within a while loop block. By adding loop conditions, the loop would exit after the potentiometers have finished calibration. 3. Before entering the while loop, the micro:bit would display a directional arrow, indicating which potentiometers requires adjustment. 4. The code within the first while loop block is to calibrate the left photoresistor, the \"if\" statement conditions are set to make the left photoresistor's analog voltage value in the range of minimum of 450 to 550 max. 5. When the \"if\" statement contitions are met in the 4th point, the micro:bit would display a \"checked\" symbol to give a visual feedback as its been calibrated. At this moment one should stop adjusting the left potentiometer. After 1 second, the code would run the \"if\" statement again to check if the values are disrupted due to slight tremor of the hand. When the code double checked if conditions are met, the loop will end. 6. The second while loop contains blocks to adjust the right photoresistor. The \"if\" statement within is to make the analog voltage values differce of both potentiometers less than 25. This is achieved by subtracting the values of both left and right photoresistors."},"/Triode-Car/en/microbit_tutorial/control_motor.html":{"title":"Use buttons to control the motors","content":"# Use buttons to control the motors ## Example Blocks <div align center> <img src \"../assets/Triode Car_motor_control_1.png\" width \"300\"/> </div> [Example project file on Github](https://github.com/Wind stormger/Makecode/blob/master/microbit Triode car_motor_control_1.hex) > After the project file is downloaded locally, it can be imported into MakeCode for viewing and re editing, or it can be burned directly to micro:bit via USB to run. ## Design description 1.

One load is a motor and the other load is a light emitting diode. In order to protect the light emitting diode, a resistor for voltage division is connected in series. In this circuit, the only one that can control the two loads is a manual switch. A **bipolar junction transistor (BJT)** is a type of transistor that uses both electrons and electron holes as charge carriers. In contrast, a unipolar transistor, such as a field effect transistor, uses only one kind of charge carrier. A bipolar transistor allows a small current injected at one of its terminals to control a much larger current flowing between two other terminals, making the device capable of amplification or switching. A BJT consists of three differently doped semiconductor regions: the emitter region, the base region and the collector region. These regions are, respectively, p type, n type and p type in a PNP transistor, and n type, p type and n type in an NPN transistor. Each semiconductor region is connected to a terminal, appropriately labeled: emitter (E), base (B) and collector (C). PNP transistor： ![](../assets/Triode S8550.png) * pin 1 Emitter * pin 2 Base * pin 3 Collector > For more detailed information, you can continue to refer to[Wikipedia：Bipolar junction transistor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_junction_transistor) Add a PNP transistor to the circuit: ![](../assets/Triode Car Sch2.png) As shown in figure design circuit may control the PNP transistor of the Base, Base terminal level signal is given, the PNP transistor can be used as a switch. The turn on condition of Emitter and Collector is that the Emitter voltage is greater than the Collector voltage, the Emitter voltage is greater than the Base voltage, and when the Base voltage is greater than or equal to the Emitter voltage, it turns off. In this way, the two loads can be controlled by the level signal received by the Base, and this level signal is provided by the output of the voltage comparator.Another button can also be used to switch to micro:bit or web:bit development boards to provide level signals. The R7 resistor acts as a pull up resistor here. When there is no control signal input to the Base, the control signal output terminal is left floating, neither high nor low, similar to an open circuit state. Through the pull up resistor of R7, Base can also obtain a high level and keep the PNP off state, so that this circuit can only be turned on when Base obtains a low level signal. > For more detailed information about \"high & low level\" and \"level signal\", please refer to [Wikipedia：Logic level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_level) ## Line detection circuit At the bottom of the Triode Car, there are two line detection circuits, each of which contains a photoresistor and an LED. When the light of the LED shines on the black and white materials, the resistance value of the photoresistor will change significantly due to the difference in reflectivity. <div align center> <img src \"../assets/Photoresistor GL5506.png\"/> </div> On Triode Car, the photoresistor used is GL5506. The resistance of this model will decrease with the increase of light. The light resistance (10 Lux illumination) is 2 5KΩ, and the dark resistance is 0.2MΩ. Light resistance: The resistance value measured under 10 Lux illumination with a standard light source (color temperature of 2854K) after being irradiated with 400 600 Lux illumination for 2 hours. Dark resistance: the resistance value measured at 10 seconds after turning off the 10 Lux illumination. Design a circuit like this: <div align center> <img src \"../assets/Triode Car Sch3.png\" width \"65%\"/> </div> It can be seen that the branch composed of RV1 adjustable resistance, R3 resistance, and R5 photoresistor is connected in parallel with the branch composed of RV2 adjustable resistance, R4 resistance, and R6 photoresistor. According to the principle of parallel equal voltage shunting, the voltages of the two branches are equal. On the branch where the R5 photoresistor is located, according to the principle of series voltage division and equal current, the voltage at the LDR_L node is equal to the current value multiplied by the (R5+R3) resistance value. When the light received by the R5 photoresistor is weakened, its resistance will increase, and the voltage at the LDR_L node will increase accordingly, and vice versa when the light increases. The same is true for LDR_R node voltage. According to the principle of series voltage division and equal current, if the resistance of the adjustable resistor of RV1 is increased, the voltage at the LDR_L node will decrease, and vice versa. The RV2 adjustable resistor is the same. In this way, the two adjustable resistors can be used to calibrate the voltage values of the two nodes of LDR_R and LDR_L, and try to ensure that the voltage values of the two nodes are equal under the same light intensity, so as to facilitate subsequent applications on the voltage comparator. ## Voltage comparator This is the schematic diagram of the LM393 voltage comparator: <div align center> <img src \"../assets/LM393_sch.jpg\" width \"250\"/> </div> <div align center> <img src \"../assets/LM393 1.png\" width \"400\"/> </div> Two voltage comparators are integrated inside. When the positive input (IN+) of the voltage comparator is greater than the negative input (IN ) voltage, the output is high. Otherwise, the output is low. The internal schematic diagram of its voltage comparator is like this: ![](../assets/LM393 2.png) This shows,the realization of such a relatively complex function is also designed and packaged based on basic components such as semiconductor diode and BJT. > If you are interested, you can refer to [Wikipedia：Comparator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparator) Add LM393 voltage comparator to the circuit, and complement the drive circuit and line detection circuit： ![](../assets/Triode Car sys.jpg) ![](../assets/Triode Car Sch4.png) At this point, we have basically constructed an automatic control system. Under ideal working conditions, it can collect light and dark information on the left and right sides of the line through the photoresistor within a certain range. The voltage comparator continuously controls the start and stop of the two wheels during the information change to correct the driving direction and achieve the purpose of automatic line tracking. ## State relation table Car lean Direction Right LDR(R6) Left LDR(R5) LDR_R Potential LDR_L Potential P3 Input P2 Input P1 Output P5 Input P6 Input P7 Output M1 Left Motor M2 Right Motor Car Move Direction : :: :: :: :: :: :: :: :: :: :: :: :: :: : Right Bright Dark 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 Left Left Dark Bright 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 Right > Conditions are black lines and white roads When the front of the car is biased to the right compared to the line: 1. The R6 photoresistor on the right under the front of the car will come above the white road, and the R5 photoresistor on the left will come above the black line. 2. The resistance of R6 decreases and the resistance of R5 increases, and the potential of the LDR_R node will be lower than the potential of the LDR_L node. 3. The P3 pin potential of the A comparator will be lower than the P2 pin potential, and the P5 pin potential of the B comparator will be higher than the P6 pin potential. 4. The P1 pin of the A comparator will output a low level, and the P7 pin of the B comparator will output a high level. 5. Q2 PNP transistor turns on, M2 right motor starts, Q1PNP transistor turns off, M1 left motor stops. 6. The car will drive to the left. When the front of the car is biased to the left compared to the line, the car will also drive to the right. In this way, Triode Car can automatically reverse correction regardless of the yaw to the left or right to achieve the purpose of tracking the line. ## line detection circuit calibration In order to make the line detection circuit have higher sensitivity to light and dark changes under the control of the LM393 chip alone, and to reduce the potential difference under the same illumination brightness, it is necessary to manually adjust the adjustable resistance for calibration. The calibration steps are as follows: 1. use a small object to lift up the back wheels slightly to prevent contact,point a stable light source towards the photoresistors. 2. Adjust either side of potentiometers until both motors are operating simultaneously. 3. After adjustments, put the car on the track to test the results. 4. If the car is still likely to run out of the track, place the car on a white paper, repeat steps 2~3 for fine tuning, and try to make the line detection circuit more sensitive to light and dark changes. <div align center> <img src \"../assets/Triodecar_calibration_1.jpg\" width \"500\"/> </div> <div align center> <img src \"../assets/Triodecar_calibration_2.jpg\" width \"500\"/> </div>"}}
